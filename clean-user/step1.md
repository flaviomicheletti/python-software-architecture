# Step 1

Here's an example folder structure that you can follow for organizing the 
different components of the Clean Architecture example in Python: 


```
├── app
│   ├── entities
│   │   └── user.py
│   ├── usecases
│   │   └── create_user.py
│   ├── interfaces
│   │   ├── input_ports.py
│   │   ├── output_ports.py
│   │   └── repositories.py
│   └── adapters
│       ├── input_adapters.py
│       └── output_adapters.py
└── main.py
```

Let's break down the purpose of each directory:

- `app`: This directory contains the core application logic and components.
- `entities`: It holds the entity classes representing the core business objects.
- `usecases`: It contains the use case classes that encapsulate the application-specific business rules and workflows.
- `interfaces`: It houses the interface classes or abstract classes that define the boundaries of the application.
  - `input_ports.py`: It defines the input port interfaces that handle interactions with external systems.
  - `output_ports.py`: It defines the output port interfaces that handle the presentation of data.
  - `repositories.py`: It defines the repository interface for data persistence.
- `adapters`: This directory contains the implementation of the interfaces/adapters.
  - `input_adapters.py`: It contains the implementation of the input port adapters.
  - `output_adapters.py`: It contains the implementation of the output port adapters.
- `main.py`: This is the entry point of your application where you can instantiate the necessary components and orchestrate their interactions.
