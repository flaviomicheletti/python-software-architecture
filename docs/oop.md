## Talk a little about OOP?

OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming paradigm that focuses
on organizing code around objects that interact with each other to solve
problems. OOP is based on four key concepts: encapsulation, inheritance,
polymorphism, and abstraction.

Encapsulation refers to the practice of bundling data and the methods that
manipulate that data together in a single unit, called an object. This
allows for information hiding and protects the data from being accessed or
modified by code outside of the object.

Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from a parent
object. This promotes code reuse and allows for more efficient development.

Polymorphism allows objects to take on many forms, depending on how they
are used. This allows for greater flexibility in programming and can make
code more modular and easier to maintain.

Abstraction refers to the practice of creating simplified representations
of complex systems. This allows programmers to focus on the essentials of a
problem and ignore irrelevant details.

Overall, OOP provides a powerful and flexible framework for building
complex applications. Many popular programming languages, including Java,
Python, and C++, are based on OOP principles.

## List

**Abstraction:** Abstraction is the practice of simplifying complex systems
by creating a model that only includes the most important details. In OOP,
this often involves defining classes that hide the implementation details
of their methods and properties, and only expose a simplified interface for
other objects to interact with.

**Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and the
methods that manipulate that data together in a single unit, called an
object. This allows for information hiding and protects the data from being
accessed or modified by code outside of the object.

**Inheritance:** Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods
from a parent object. This promotes code reuse and allows for more
efficient development.

**Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects to take on many forms,
depending on how they are used. This allows for greater flexibility in
programming and can make code more modular and easier to maintain.

**Class:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects that share
common properties and behaviors.

**Object:** An object is an instance of a class, which contains its own set
of data and methods.

**Method:** A method is a function that is associated with an object or
class.

**Message Passing:** Message passing is the process of sending a message from
one object to another object in order to trigger a response.

**Interface:** An interface is a set of methods and properties that define a
contract for how objects of a certain class should behave. Interfaces can
be used to ensure that objects from different classes can interact with
each other in a consistent way.

**Constructor:** A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize
the data of an object when it is created.

**Destructor:** A destructor is a special method that is used to clean up an
object when it is no longer needed.

**Static binding:** Static binding refers to the process of linking a method
call to the method implementation at compile time.

**Dynamic binding:** Dynamic binding refers to the process of linking a
method call to the method implementation at runtime.

**Composition:** Composition is a design pattern in which objects are
composed of other objects, rather than inheriting from them.

**Aggregation:** Aggregation is a type of composition in which one object
contains references to other objects, but those objects can exist
independently of the parent object.

**Association:** Association is a relationship between two objects, which can
be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.

**Dependency:** Dependency is a relationship between two objects in which one
object depends on the other to perform a certain task.

**Overloading:** Overloading is the practice of defining multiple methods
with the same name, but with different parameters or return types.

**Overriding:** Overriding is the practice of defining a method in a subclass
that has the same name, parameters, and return type as a method in its
parent class.

**Access modifiers:** Access modifiers are keywords in OOP languages that
determine which parts of a class are visible to other classes. The three
most common access modifiers are public, private, and protected.

**Abstract classes:** Abstract classes are classes that cannot be
instantiated, but serve as a template for creating other classes.

**Interfaces:** Interfaces are similar to abstract classes, but they only
define a set of methods and properties, without providing any
implementation details.

**Inheritance hierarchy:** Inheritance hierarchy is the arrangement of
classes in a hierarchy, based on their inheritance relationships.

**Multiple inheritance:** Multiple inheritance is the practice of inheriting
properties and methods from multiple parent classes.

**Casting:** Casting is the process of converting an object from one data
type to another.

**Virtual methods:** Virtual methods are methods that can be overridden by a
subclass.

**Final classes:** Final classes are classes that cannot be subclassed.

**Final methods:** Final methods are methods that cannot be overridden by a
subclass.

**Inner classes:** Inner classes are classes that are defined inside another
class.

**Reflection:** Reflection is a mechanism in some OOP languages that allows a
program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.

**Generics (templates):** Generics, also known as templates in some programming
languages, allow classes and methods to be defined with a placeholder for a
data type, which can be filled in at runtime.
