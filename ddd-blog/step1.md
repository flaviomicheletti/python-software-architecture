# Step 1 

Let's start with a basic example related to a blog domain.

In DDD, the focus is on designing and modeling the core business domain and 
its entities. The domain entities encapsulate behavior and hold the business 
rules. Let's create a simple `Post` entity representing a blog post. 

```python
class Post:
    def __init__(self, title, content):
        self.title = title
        self.content = content
        self.published = False

    def publish(self):
        self.published = True

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Title: {self.title}\nContent: {self.content}\nPublished: {self.published}"
```

In this example, the `Post` class has three attributes: `title`, `content`, 
and `published`. The `published` attribute keeps track of whether the post 
has been published or not. 

We have defined a `publish` method that allows us to change the state of the `
published` attribute to `True`. We also have a `__str__` method to provide a 
string representation of the `Post` object. 

Let's create an instance of the `Post` class and interact with it:

```python
# Create a new post
new_post = Post("Introduction to DDD", "Domain-Driven Design is a software development approach...")

# Print the initial state of the post
print(new_post)

# Publish the post
new_post.publish()

# Print the updated state of the post
print(new_post)
```

When you run this code, you will see the initial state of the post and then 
the updated state after publishing it. 

This is a very basic example, but it demonstrates the idea of encapsulating 
behavior and state within a domain entity. In a real-world scenario, you 
would likely have more complex entities, aggregates, repositories, and 
services, but this example should give you a starting point for understanding 
how DDD can be implemented in Python.
