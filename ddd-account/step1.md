# Step 1

In a typical DDD project, the folder structure is organized based on the 
different domains and subdomains within the application. In the case of the 
Account domain, you can follow a structure similar to the one described 
below: 

```
account/
├── application/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── account_service.py
│   └── account_repository.py
│
├── domain/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── account.py
│   └── value_objects.py
│
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── account_repository_impl.py
│   └── database.py
│
└── __init__.py
```

Let's go through each folder and its contents:

- `account/application`: This folder contains the application layer, which 
includes application services and repositories. The application services 
coordinate the interaction between the domain models, perform use case-
specific operations, and handle transactions if necessary. The repository 
interfaces and their implementations reside in this folder as well. 

- `account/domain`: This folder contains the domain layer, which encapsulates 
the core business logic of the Account domain. It includes the domain model 
class(es) such as `Account` in our example, as well as any relevant value 
objects that are used within the domain model. Value objects represent 
concepts that have no conceptual identity and are immutable. 

- `account/infrastructure`: This folder contains the infrastructure layer, 
which deals with the implementation details such as data persistence, 
external services, or any other technical concerns. Here, you would find 
implementations of the repository interfaces defined in the application 
layer, along with any other infrastructure-related code. 

- `account/__init__.py`: This file is typically an empty file and it denotes 
that the `account` directory is a Python package. 

This folder structure provides a clear separation of concerns and helps to 
organize the different components of the Account domain based on their 
responsibilities. It's important to note that this is just a basic example, 
and in more complex scenarios, you may have additional folders and sub-
packages to further organize the codebase.
