# Step 3

In the context of Clean Architecture, the file structure may follow a layered 
approach with separation of concerns. Here's an example file structure for 
the "Account" context within Clean Architecture: 

```
account/
├── application/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── use_cases/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── create_account.py
│   │   ├── deposit.py
│   │   └── withdraw.py
│   └── interfaces/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── account_repository.py
│
├── domain/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   └── repositories.py
│
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── database/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── account_repository_impl.py
│   └── external_services/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── notification_service.py
│
└── __init__.py
```

Let's go through each folder and its contents:

- `account/application`: This folder contains the application layer, which includes use cases (application-specific operations) and interfaces for interacting with external components.
  - `account/application/use_cases`: This subfolder contains the application use cases related to the "Account" context. For example, `create_account.py`, `deposit.py`, `withdraw.py`, etc.
  - `account/application/interfaces`: This subfolder contains the interfaces that define the contract between the application layer and the domain layer. For example, `account_repository.py` defines the methods expected from an account repository implementation.

- `account/domain`: This folder contains the domain layer, which represents the core business logic of the "Account" context.
  - `account/domain/models.py`: This file contains the domain models or entities related to accounts.

- `account/infrastructure`: This folder contains the infrastructure layer, which deals with the implementation details and external dependencies.
  - `account/infrastructure/database`: This subfolder contains database-related code and implementations.
    - `account/infrastructure/database/account_repository_impl.py`: This file implements the account repository interface and handles the database operations specific to the "Account" context.
  - `account/infrastructure/external_services`: This subfolder contains code related to external services or integrations.
    - `account/infrastructure/external_services/notification_service.py`: This file represents an external service (e.g., a notification service) that can be used by the application layer.

- `account/__init__.py`: This file is typically an empty file and denotes that the `account` directory is a Python package.

This file structure follows the principles of Clean Architecture by 
separating the layers and dependencies. The application layer contains use 
cases and interfaces, the domain layer holds the core business logic, and the 
infrastructure layer manages implementation details and external services. 

Please note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world 
application, you may have additional files, folders, and sub-packages based 
on the complexity and specific needs of your "Account" context within Clean 
Architecture.
